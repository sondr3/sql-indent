* SQL-indent

This is sql-indent for Emacs.

It was originally written by [[http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/AlexSchroeder][Alex Schroeder]]  and used to live on [[http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs?SqlIndent][emacswiki.org]].

Usage note:

Loading this file will make all SQL mode buffers created from then on use
`sql-indent-line' for indentation. A possible way to install sql-indent.el would
be to add the following to your .emacs:

```emacs-lisp
(eval-after-load "sql"
  '(load-library "sql-indent"))
```

To run the tests:

1. Install [Cask](https://github.com/cask/cask).
2. Run `cask`.
3. Run `make test`.
